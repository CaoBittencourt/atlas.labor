[x] vectorizing ttc in Omega function results in subset bugs when ttc is not a list of functions
[x] should Omega even be vectorized on ttc?

[?] investigate kde quantiles and mock data

[ ] remove assert args from internal functions
    create type-safe versions of functions for the end user,
    including a version with more expressive names

    learn how to export only a few functions from package (i.e. modular R)

[x] Omega_vec2: remove lmin, lmax and infer add lbound_vec as arg
    infer lmin, lmax for each job subtype by shifting indexes in lbound_vec
    i.e. for all v in 1:length(lbound_vec) lmin[v] = lbound_vec[v-1] and lmax[v] = lbound_vec[v]

[ ] refactor remaining functions to work with Omega_vec2 instead of Omega_vec
[x] select which functions to export to avoid polluting the namespace
